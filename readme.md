# Deepfake Detection

This repository contains code and experiments for detecting deepfake videos using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and LSTM. Deepfakes—synthetic media generated by AI—pose significant risks to trust, security, and society. This project implements and compares multiple models to classify real and fake videos.

## ✨ Features

- 📌 **Face Extraction**: Automatically detects and crops faces from video frames.
- 🧠 **Deep Neural Network-based Classifier**: Custom deep neural network trained to detect forgery artifacts.
- 🏷 **Binary Classification**: Outputs real or fake labels with probabilities.
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.

## 📂 Datasets

The models have been tested on publicly available deepfake datasets such as:

- **Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC)**
- **Celeb-DF**

Datasets are not included in this repository due to size constraints. You can download them separately and configure the paths as needed.
