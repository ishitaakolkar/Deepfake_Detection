abstract="A deepfake is a computer-generated video or image where one person's face is replaced with another face of a person which uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to create and alter images that are practically impossible for humans to distinguish from authentic ones. The development of GAN technology has led to significant improvements in image generation. This progress has made it difficult for humans to differentiate between generated images and raised concerns about their misuse and also creating security threats for the society. Deepfake image detection is an essential challenge because the current methods often face inaccuracy and time-consuming issues. The research work employed GAN discriminators to address these issues. The experiment used the CelebA dataset, which contained diverse celebrity images. Moreover, the proposed model consists of components i.e., generator and discriminator. The generator creates fake data from the training images, while the discriminator distinguishes real from the fake images. The result shows that the proposed approach is out-performing with an accuracy of 95.8{\%} in identifying deep fake images, even in the presence of various manipulations. The proposed model is helpful for enhancing trust and security in the society.",
